    "# General Clickthrough Rate Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see from the expressions above that when there is **no abandonment** - model does not account for the fact that user may be dissatisfied with the list to the extent in which she leaves before even seeing all the documents - the clickthrough rate **expression does not factorize**. Notice then, that only DBN and CCM models account for the abandonment.\n",

    "## The formula\n",
    "The general expression for clickthrough rate of the models metioned above is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "CTR^\\mathcal{M}(1:K) = 1 - (1 - \\gamma_r\\alpha_{d_r})(1 - \\lambda CTR^\\mathcal{M}(2:K))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's take the simpliest model of all - $\\mathcal{M} = CM$ - which does not account for abandonment, i.e. $\\lambda = 1$, and the probability of clicking on a document is influenced only by the document's relevance, i.e. $\\gamma_r = 1,r\\in\\{1,\\ldots,K\\}$. By pluging these into the formula we get the expression for $CTR^{CM}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimal Document Ranking\n",
    "The optimal document ranking need to be derived only from the general formula above. For that matter we can see that the ordering of documents is determined by probabilities of attractiveness ($\\alpha$), examination ($\\gamma$), and abandonment ($\\lambda$). Because the models accounting for abandonment assume that it is constant, we can put it aside, but in more general case, when the abandonment depended on a rank, for example, it would be a nice exercise to see how it influences the ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the **optimal K-ordering** based on known parameters of $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$ should be made such that $i$-th most relevant document should be put on the rank with $i$-th highest probability of examination.\n",
